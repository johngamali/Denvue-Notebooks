# DENVUE Notebook  
A Machine Learning–Based Dengue Case Estimation and Decision-Support Framework  
for Cagayan de Oro City

This repository contains the official analytical and modeling notebooks for **DENVUE**, a data science–driven framework developed to support dengue case estimation and decision-making in **Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines**.

The notebooks document the complete analytical workflow applied to **historical dengue case records from 2018 to 2024**, serving as the computational foundation for model development and evaluation used in the DENVUE system.

## Project Description

Dengue remains a persistent public health concern in Cagayan de Oro City. Conventional reporting systems often rely on retrospective summaries, which limits deeper analytical insight at finer temporal resolutions. DENVUE addresses this limitation by applying machine learning techniques directly to historical dengue case data to identify patterns, estimate case levels, and support data-driven public health analysis.

The notebooks in this repository are designed to:
- Analyze historical dengue case trends from 2018 to 2024
- Examine temporal patterns and fluctuations in reported cases
- Develop machine learning models for dengue case estimation
- Support analytical decision-making through quantitative results

## Notebook Scope and Contents

This repository includes notebooks covering the following components:

- Data Preparation  
  Cleaning, validation, and structuring of dengue case records covering 2018–2024.

- Exploratory Data Analysis  
  Statistical and temporal analysis of dengue case trends and distributions.

- Feature Engineering  
  Construction of derived features from historical case data to support modeling.

- Machine Learning Modeling  
  Development of regression and classification models for dengue case estimation.

- Model Evaluation and Interpretation  
  Assessment of model performance using standard evaluation metrics and analytical interpretation.

Outputs generated from these notebooks are used to support downstream visualization and reporting components of the DENVUE system.
